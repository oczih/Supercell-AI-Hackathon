1kol8z5,Hot Take: Evolutions are the BEST update this game has ever had. (It's just not executed very well),100,49,2025-05-17 08:12:47,https://i.redd.it/az2khor4z91f1.png,"Lets be honest here, Evo's add a new layer of strategy into Clash Royale and is a NEEDED update for the game. Unlike level 15 and the recent chest removal, Evo's adds new gameplay to Royale and makes the game wayyy more fun. The problem is that they are hard to get (You would probably get 0 - 2 evo's per season from Events and Lucky Drops). Just fix that issue and Evo's would be incredible.",0.66
1ko9ubk,Evos have completely ruined the game,508,156,2025-05-16 22:40:31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ko9ubk,"Hello everyone, I played the game pretty much since launch consistently for 3-4 years (screenshots attached for proof). This week I decided to come back to the game after pretty much years off (I would maybe play 2-3 games a year) and evos have made this game borderline unplayable. To play at a semi competitive level is near impossible without them. While I will admit a lot of the changes made since I last played have been super nice and new player friendly, but putting in evos is much more of a money grab than anything before. A majority of the games I lose come down to me not having evos. Now I’m forced to play with one deck until I actually get evos which seems like months to years away. I miss when you could play this game with even under leveled cards and win but now with evos the edge given to the player using them is way too high. 

Before anyone says anything the battle deck is not the current deck I’m using, I have no idea why that’s there.",0.89
