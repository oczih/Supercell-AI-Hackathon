The problem is that they make the game much more matchup dependent.

Lots of evolutions simply remove some forms of counterplay to a card.

Take Evolved Royal Giant for example. This is one of the weakest evolutions but its whole mechanic is preventing swarms from countering the giant. As a result, entire deck archetypes which used to have a fairly balanced matchup against Royal Giant now have an almost guaranteed loss against it.

Evos are currently in a weird state, we can use two evos per deck but yet we have a lack of receiving even one for free.
