The idea being that you get a powered up version of a card you really like, but one that is balanced around cards of it's own cost. Maybe they use a champion slot, maybe you can design more evos to have champion-like activatable effects. Whatever the case, the whole cycling evo cards to get to the evo you need and the whole thing where you can get stop am entire push with the right evo make the game feel way more toxic than when I started. Also, the evos are so strong you have to use the limited evo card pool in every deck you wanna make. Wanna try a combo of non evo cards?
